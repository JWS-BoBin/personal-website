                            <h5>Joy as Resistance</h5> 
                            <p>The "talking blues" style is fundamentally funny. By using comedy and a half-spoken, rhythmic delivery, artists transform serious topics into engaging performance. This joy is not an escape but a strategic act of resistance, asserting that critique can be delivered with a wry smile.</p>


                            <h5>Resistance</h5>
                            <p>Resistance is at the core of the talking blues, in its folk form. Many of these songs challenge the dominant political, economic, and social narratives. 


                            <h5>Power</h5>
                            <p>The talking blues explicitly critiques concentrated power in corporations, media, and government; and gives a voice to marginalized perspectives>.</p>


                            <h5>Humanity</h5>
                            <p>Humor is a deeply human thing. By connecting it to political critique, it reaches people to the soul.</p>


                            <h5>Idealization</h5>
                            <p>The talking blues is a direct challenge to an idealized version of America.

                            <h5>Solidarity</h5>
                            <p>By articulating common struggles in a shared, accessible vernacular, the talking blues is a potent force for building solidarity. An great example is "Talking Union," a union song fostering solidarity as a social and political force.</p>

                            <h5>Assimilation</h5>
                            <p>The accessible micro-genre has been used by many artists beyond folk. A notable example is "Singing in Viet Nam Talking Blues" by Johnny Cash.</p>

                            <p>A variation on the "Save the Last Word" activity, this allows students to analyze lyrics to not only understand what the songs are about but also how they're valuable to political movements.</p>

                            <p>Talking Blues is a great paired resource, because many of these songs are overtly political.</p>

                            <p>If the technology is available, the students can also listen to a given song while reading the lyrics to fully appreciate the piece of work.</p>

                            <p>Students at a table select lyrics that interest them, perhaps for their commentary, prehaps for other reasons. They discuss with their group, then the groups share with the class.</p>

                            <p><em>
                                Back in Nineteen Twenty-Seven,<br>
                                I had a little farm and I called that heaven.<br>
                                Well, the prices up and the rain come down,<br>
                                And I hauled my crops all into town --<br>
                                I got the money, bought clothes and groceries,<br>
                                Fed the kids, and raised a family.<br>
                                <br>
                                Rain quit and the wind got high,<br>
                                And the black ol' dust storm filled the sky.<br>
                                And I swapped my farm for a Ford machine,<br>
                                And I poured it full of this gas-i-line --<br>
                                And I started, rockin' an' a-rollin',<br>
                                Over the mountains, out towards the old Peach Bowl.<br>
                                <br>
                                Way up yonder on a mountain road,<br>
                                I had a hot motor and a heavy load,<br>
                                I's a-goin' pretty fast, there wasn't even stoppin',<br>
                                A-bouncin' up and down, like popcorn poppin' --<br>
                                Had a breakdown, sort of a nervous bustdown of some kind,<br>
                                There was a feller there, a mechanic feller,<br>
                                Said it was en-gine trouble.<br>

                                Way up yonder on a mountain curve,<br>
                                It's way up yonder in the piney wood,<br>
                                An' I give that rollin' Ford a shove,<br>
                                An' I's a-gonna coast as far as I could --<br>
                                Commence coastin', pickin' up speed,<br>
                                Was a hairpin turn, I didn't make it.<br>
                                <br>
                                Man alive, I'm a-tellin' you,<br>
                                The fiddles and the guitars really flew.<br>
                                That Ford took off like a flying squirrel<br>
                                An' it flew halfway around the world --<br>
                                Scattered wives and childrens<br>
                                All over the side of that mountain.<br>
                                <br>
                                We got out to the West Coast broke,<br>
                                So dad-gum hungry I thought I'd croak,<br>
                                An' I bummed up a spud or two,<br>
                                An' my wife fixed up a tater stew --<br>
                                We poured the kids full of it,<br>
                                Mighty thin stew, though,<br>
