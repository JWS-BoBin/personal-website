                            <p>The song fits into quite a few themes from class.</p>

                            <p>"We Shall Overcome" is rooted in I'll Overcome Some Day and I'll be All Right, both rooted in African American culture.</p>
                            <p>Interviews were also recorded with Pete Seeger and Jamila Jones. Copyright was made by Pete Seeger, Guy Carawan and Frank Hamilton. In 1956 at age 12, Jamila Jones added a new verse to "We Shall Overcome."</p>
                            <p>After Kate Stewart published her article in 2014, it was discovered that a woman by the name of Louise Shropshire wrote a hymn called "If My Jesus Wills" which was claimed to be direct inspiration for "We Shall Overcome".</p>
                            <p>The copyright to "We Shall Overcome" was challenged in court and voluntarily relinquished by its publishers in 2018 after historical evidence, including Shropshire's hymn, demonstrated the song's status as a traditional folk work in the public domain.</p>

                            <h5>Heroification</h5> 
                            <p>Pete Seeger is rightly upheld as a pillar of integrity and solidarity. Yet even our heroes of any movement are not perfect, complicated by flaws and controversies, such as the disputes surrounding the copyright and attribution for "We Shall Overcome."</p>
                            
                            <h5>Power</h5> 
                            <p>The transformative power of song is central, as "We Shall Overcome" was powerfully embraced by the Civil Rights Movement, demonstrating how music can fuel and sustain social change.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Resistance</h5> 
                            <p>The song was inherently created and adopted as an anthem of protest, a direct musical tool for challenging injustice and asserting collective strength.</p>

                            <h5>Solidarity</h5> 
                            <p>Music like "We Shall Overcome" plays a crucial role in building solidarity, helping to unify diverse individuals within a movement around a shared identity and common purpose.</p>

                            <h5>Humanity</h5> 
                            <p>The emphatic "We" in "We Shall Overcome" underscores a fundamental theme: that humanity is not a solitary experience but an interconnected community facing struggles together.</p>

                            <h5>What Does It Mean to Be American?</h5> 
                            <p>The song raises core American questions: Who is the "we" that shall overcome? What systemic obstacles must they overcome? And what does their struggle reveal about the nation's ideals and realities?</p>
                            
                            <h5>Erasure</h5> 
                            <p>While often unintentional, a notable erasure occurred in the historical narrative of "We Shall Overcome," where a key contributor, Louise Shropshire, was overlooked for decades.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Reframing/Reclaiming</h5> 
                            <p>Recent historical revelations about the song's origins have allowed for a reframing of its story, reclaiming the credit and recognition.</p>

                            <h5>Omitted Voices/Stories/Perspectives</h5> 
                            <p>The erasure of certain creators points to the broader omission of vital voices and perspectives in popular history, a gap that reclaiming efforts seek to address.</p>

                                <p>Part of the inspiration for this is that Louise Shropshire did not receive proper credit for her contribution to the song. Having the students participate via silent conversation will hopefull connect some dots.</p>
                                <h5>Dramatization</h5>
                                <p>We should consider if this is dramatization. I would say no, as this connection will not be explicitly made. Perhaps students will notice during a debrief. However, since silent conversation is an establsiehd classroom activity, I would not consider it a gimmick here.</p>
