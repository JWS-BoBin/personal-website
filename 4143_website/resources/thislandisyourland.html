                            <p>Guthrie felt the lyics to "God Bless America" were too patriotic and sappy, divorced from the tough reality many Americans experienced during the Great Depression.</p>

                            <p>Originally written with an anti-capitalist bend with the lyrics: <br>
                            <em>
                                As I went walking I saw a sign there<br> 
                                And on the sign it said “No Trespassing.”<br> 
                                But on the other side it didn't say nothing,<br> 
                                That side was made for you and me.<br>
                                <br>
                                In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,<br> 
                                By the relief office I seen my people;<br>
                                As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking<br>
                                Is this land made for you and me?<br>
                            </em>

                            <p>He dropped those lyrics at some point, but the final version still resonates with the listener.</p>

                            <p>Official lyrics posted in the article:
                            <em>
                                <br>This land is your land, this land is my land <br>
                                From California to the New York island; 
                                From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters <br>
                                This land was made for you and me. <br>
                                <br>
                                As I was walking that ribbon of highway, <br>
                                I saw above me that endless skyway: <br>
                                I saw below me that golden valley: <br>
                                This land was made for you and me. <br>
                                <br>
                                I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps <br>
                                To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts; <br>
                                And all around me a voice was sounding: <br>
                                This land was made for you and me. <br>
                                <br>
                                When the sun came shining, and I was strolling, <br>
                                And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling, <br>
                                As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting: <br>
                                This land was made for you and me. <br>
                                <br>
                                As I went walking I saw a sign there <br>
                                And on the sign it said "No Trespassing." <br>
                                But on the other side it didn't say nothing, <br>
                                That side was made for you and me. <br>
                                <br>
                                In the squares of the city, in the shadow of the steeple, <br>
                                By the relief office I seen my people; <br>
                                As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking <br>
                                Is this land made for you and me? <br>
                                <br>
                                Nobody living can ever stop me, <br>
                                As I go walking that freedom highway; <br>
                                Nobody living can ever make me turn back <br>
                                This land was made for you and me.

                            <h5>Idealization</h5>
                            <p>The song directly responds to and challenges the sentimental, shallow patriotism of "God Bless America," which ignored the harsh realities many Americans experienced during the Great Depression.</p>
                            <h5>Resistance</h5>
                            <p>The omitted verses explicitly critique capitalism and private property. Even without them, the song's framing of land as a collective right questions exclusive ownership and inequality.</p>
                            <h5>What does it mean to be American?</h5>
                            <p>The song poses a fundamental question: What does it mean to belong here? Guthrie shifts the focus from a nation "blessed by God" (passive, top-down) to a land "made for you and me" (inclusive, bottom up).</p>
                            <h5>Reclaiming/Reframing</h5>
                            <p>Guthrie's work is a deliberate effort to reclaim the concept of America from a commercial, patriotic mainstream.</p>
