Introduction
Many people associate rock & roll with counter-culture, but folk music actually played a more significant and earlier role. With roots in an anti-racist, anti-corporate, and often anti-capitalist ethos, folk music provided the soundtrack for a counter-narrative. In the 1940s, musicians like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger wrote pro-union anthems, while artists like Lead Belly performed songs rooted in the Black experience that highlighted American racism.

This tradition continued throughout the 1950s and peaked in the 1960s, which produced the best-known names in folk: Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Peter, Paul & Mary. Paradoxically, folk's mainstream success may have contributed to its decline, as commercial incentives diluted its anti-establishment roots.

Folk music offers a powerful case study in the symbiotic relationship between protest and art. Teaching it, however, must include the flaws of its icons, including Guthrie and Seeger. We can only fully honor these artists by humanizing them. Another pitfall is losing the forest for the trees; it is not enough to simply play folk songs. Songs must be carefully contextualized and curated for their political relationships so students can understand the connection between art and social movements.

Folk Music Revival

Broadside Magazine (Nos 1-110)
Sing Out! Publications. (n.d.). Broadside. Retrieved December 3, 2025, from https://singout.org/broadside/

****
Issue 23, page 1

Why This Source
Founded by Agnes Cunninham and Gordon Friesen in 1962, Broadside was a magazine that covered the folk revival. (Dicaire, 2011)

Broadside is an amazing primary source that provides contemporary context, songs and plenty of options for class interaction.

Issues, or sections of issues, can be selected for curated activities, making it highly adaptable for educational use.


Show Less
Summary
Broadside was a popular magazine created within and centered around the folk music scene of the 1960s.

It was a unique combination of songbook, poetry, photocopied news articles, and other elements such as the occasional cartoon.

It featured contributions from major folk and protest music figures, including Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Pete Seeger, and Nina Simone.


Show Less
Critical Analysis
Omitted stories
As a document centered on the folk scene's perspective, Broadside provides a specific look into the political counterculture of the 1960s. Its focus necessarily omits or provides a counter-narrative to the stories promoted by contemporary government and corporate media, offering a curated view of the era's struggles and triumphs from the ground level.

Power & resistance
Broadside was a vocal critic of the political and social establishment, using song and commentary as direct tools of protest. Simultaneously, it functioned as an empowering platform that circumvented mainstream media, giving a direct voice and promotional power to songwriters whose work challenged the status quo.

Solidarity
The magazine served as a vital nexus for the folk community, fostering a shared identity and political consciousness. By publishing lyrics, stories, and news, it created a common text and purpose that brought artists and activists together across the country.

Joy as Resistance
Beyond its protest material, the magazine was a celebration of folk music and folk culture. This celebration—through sharing songs, cartoons, and poetry—was itself an act of resistance, affirming the value and vitality of a culture that stood outside the commercial mainstream.

A wonderful resource provided by the Smithsonian, with an educational mission.

Summary
Smithsonian Folkways Recordings is the nonprofit record label of the Smithsonian Institution. The Young People's Records (YPR) collection is part of this archive, originating as an educational tool designed to be less commercial than mainstream children's media.

The label is an exceptional resource for folk music because it provides access to authentic primary sources. It hosts thousands of recordings from around the world, each accompanied by educational liner notes that detail the music's cultural and historical context. Smithsonian Folkways also offers ready-to-use lesson plans for educators.

I am highlighting one lesson plan, "Protest Songs: A Musical Introduction," designed by Amy R. Kenny for grades 6-8. For my Classroom Activities, I will adapt it for the elementary level.

Critical Analysis
Normalization
The YPR collection explicitly resisted the commercial, profit-driven model of children's entertainment. By prioritizing educational and cultural content over marketability, it challenged the normalization of consumerism in childhood and presented an alternative model where art and learning were not solely commodities.

Omitted Voices/Stories/Perspectives
As an archive, Smithsonian Folkways actively works against cultural erasure by preserving and promoting the music of marginalized, indigenous, and minority communities worldwide.

Windows and Mirrors
The vast global collection provides students with both "windows" into diverse cultures and "mirrors" for students to see their own heritage.

Protest Songs Lesson
Class activity

Summary
Using the Protest Songs: A Musical Introduction lesson plan designed by Amy R Kenny (n.d.).

This lesson plan introduces three songs to the students, two of which they would be familiar from other lessons-“This Land is Your Land” (Guthrie, 1951) and “We Shall Overcome” (Seeger, 1963)--and two that would be new--“Turn, Turn, Turn” (Seeger, 1962) and “We Are Soldiers in the Army” (The Freedom Singers, 2010)

The original lesson plan is pretty straight forward, involving students evaluating and discussing the music and history.

This can be adapted into snowball, where students write down their ideas about the songs, or fishbowl, where they can discuss the songs and history of folk and protest.

Why This Source
Note: This is part of their annual non-bastard series

This multi-part podcast series hosted by Robert Evans, How Woody Guthrie Turned Folk Music into a Weapon, explores Guthrie's life through various historical sources and perspectives.

This podcast has a distinct political bend, which sits comfortably in the counter-narrative sub-genre of historical podcasts. It offers a critical perspective on Guthrie's life, music, and political activism.

Guthrie is arguably the most important figure in the first half of the folk music revival, and this source provides valuable insight into how his music was shaped by and contributed to social movements of his time.


Show Less
Summary
Woody Guthrie was born in Oklahoma in 1912. Between Oklahoma and Texas, Guthrie had a difficult childhood, marked by family tragedy, abuse, and instability. His experiences as a Dust Bowl migrant and working-class advocate during the Great Depression deeply informed his music, leading him to write up to a thousand songs, which he famously refused to tightly copyright.

Guthrie's life was one of continual personal growth and political engagement. Though he participated in activities he later regretted, like minstrel shows and faith healing, he evolved into a staunch anti-racist and collaborator with Black musicians. He claimed communist sympathies, served in the Merchant Marine during WWII. His most famous song is "This Land Is Your Land."

In the late 1940s, Guthrie began showing symptoms of Huntington's disease, which led to his institutionalization from 1956 until his death in 1967. Though he never achieved great financial success, he became an immensely influential figure within the folk music community, leaving a legacy of artistic integrity and social justice.


Show Less
Critical Analysis
Power & Resistance
Woody Guthrie was a persistent critic of established political and economic power structures. His music and life explicitly championed the working class and the dispossessed, resisting the narratives of the powerful through anthems of solidarity and protest during the Great Depression and beyond.

Heroification
While Guthrie is rightly admired as a folk hero and a voice for justice, his legacy is complicated by personal flaws and early actions he later regretted. A full understanding of his life requires acknowledging this complex humanity, ensuring our admiration is for the real, evolving person rather than a simplified myth.

What does it mean to be American?
Guthrie was constantly writing songs that beg the question. Through it he also questioned the idealization and normalization that was pushed onto the American people by the powers that be.

Woody Guthrie Discussion
Class activity

Summary
This lesson plan uses the teacher knowledge from the BTB podcast series on Woody Guthrie, combined with the content of Broadside Magazine Issue 16 (1962).

Inspired by the curriculum exploration, students are placed into small groups. Each group is assigned one page (excluding page 1) from the 7-page Broadside issue. This particular issue focuses on songs and writings about James Meredith--a Black man engaged in a historic legal battle to desegregate the University of Mississippi. (Meredith's life story is fascinating and could easily be its own "Doing Social Studies" topic!)

This segues into a discussion, beginning with the Woody Guthrie song featured on page 1 of the issue. After analyzing the song's lyrics and context, the lesson expands to explore Guthrie's dual legacy:

His foundational role in the Folk Music Revival.
His early, flawed actions, such as performing in blackface.
This leads to a critical conversation about "heroification," recognizing even admirable historical figures are complex. The key takeaway is Guthrie's personal growth. He matured from this bigoted mindset, later forming friendships and touring with Black musicians.

His story serves two purposes: it complicates a simplistic heroic narrative often told of Guthrie while demonstrating the capacity for personal growth and redemption.

This theme can be further connected to Odetta: A Life in Music and Protest (Zack, 2020), which notes that Odetta performed at Guthrie's memorial service.

Folk Music Revival

Odetta: A Life in Music and Protest
Zack, I. (2020). Odetta: A life in music and protest. Beacon Press.

Odetta: A Life in Music and Protest
Why This Source
Ian Zack's biography, Odetta: A Life in Music and Protest, provides a look into the folk music revival through the lens of a seminal yet often overlooked figure: Odetta Holmes.

The book details Odetta's intersections with major icons of the era, including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Harry Belafonte. While she profoundly influenced these artists, Odetta never achieved the same level of mainstream commercial success as Dylan, Baez, Belafonte, or groups like Peter, Paul and Mary.

For an educator, this biography offers a solid foundation for understanding the folk revival scene while deliberately centering a pivotal, but oft overlooked, artist whose legacy as a musical and political force is crucial to the movement's full story.


Show Less
Summary
Odetta Holmes was born in Birmingham, Alabama in 1930, and her childhood was shaped by the Great Depression and the racism of the Jim Crow South. Moving to Los Angeles in 1937, she was deeply affected by the racism in school textbooks, later saying her true education came through folk music. Recognized for her powerful voice from a young age, she found her calling in the folk scenes of San Francisco and later New York.

Her physical presence was as distinctive as her sound. Standing nearly six feet tall with a notable afro she refused to straighten, she was self-conscious yet defiantly visible. She would often perform with her eyes closed. She was managed by Albert Grossman (who managed many major folk figures). For a long time, she preferred to let her music do the talking, a principle that earned criticism, but also empathy from other Black performers. Some of the most famous from her repertoire included "Take This Hammer" and the "Freedom Trilogy." A friend to Nina Simone and collaborator with Harry Belafonte, Odetta was a pillar at the intersection of music and civil rights, consciously performing in non-segregated venues and famously singing at the 1965 March on Washington. Martin Luther King called her "The Voice of the Civil Rights Movement."

Despite her profound influence, Odetta never achieved the mainstream commercial success of contemporaries like Bob Dylan or Joan Baez. Financial strains, partly from a failed marriage, persisted. In later decades, she became more overtly active in political movements and explored blues, but never recaptured the peak of her folk career. Her legacy remains that of a foundational, yet often overlooked, voice whose music channeled the struggle and spirit of a movement.

Her story of notable success without the financial windfall is a common theme for many other folk artists.


Show Less
Critical Analysis
Omitted (overlooked) stories
Odetta's lack of mainstream success compared to peers like Joan Baez or Bob Dylan positions her biography as a helpful addition to the historical record. Her story highlights a foundational yet often overlooked figure whose artistic and political influence was immense.

Power
While her career trajectory cannot be attributed to any single factor, Odetta's experience as a Black woman in mid-20th century America invites critical reflection on how race and gender shaped opportunities and recognition within the folk revival and the broader music industry.

What does it mean to be American?
Odetta's life centralizes the complex question of what it means to be American. Her identity as a Black woman and her unofficial title as "the voice of the Civil Rights Movement" embody a narrative of struggle, resilience, and cultural contribution that challenges simpler national myths.

Resistance
Odetta's deliberate choice to wear her hair in a natural afro, rather than conform to straightened styles, was a potent and visible act of political resistance. This personal statement defied beauty standards and asserted Black pride during a pivotal era for civil rights. Zack claims she is was a trendsetter, the first notable Black woman to have an afro in American music.

Idealization
Her story directly confronts the idyllic portrayal of 1950s America. Through her music and lived experience with segregation and racism, Odetta's biography reveals the tensions and injustices simmering beneath the era's often polished surface.

Summary
Using the book as a reference, many songs, pictures and videos of Odetta can be collected.

Summary
To begin, students will explore the provided photo gallery resource. Their first task is to select images that resonate with them based on a thematic prompt, such as: "Find pictures of music and protest that resonate with you."

Next, we will create a collaborative gallery in the classroom. Incorporating the photos students have chosen, we will scatter the images on desks or tables. Students will then participate in a gallery walk, moving quietly to observe and reflect on the collection. Topical music can be played during this portion of the activity!

Finally, this visual exploration will transition into a structured dialogue. Using discussion formats like fishbowl, students will analyze the images, share their interpretations, and explore the historical and emotional connections between music and social movements.

*******
 An image of Bouchillon ([The Original Talking Blues Man], n.d.)

Why This Source
A defining tradition of folk music is its malleability. Songs are not fixed artifacts but living pieces passed down and reshaped by various artists over time, each adapting the sound and lyrics. The "Talking Blues" exemplifies this tradition.

Summary
The original, "Talking Blues," was composed by blues and country musician Chris Bouchillon, who had a signature 'talking' style and a comedic bend.

This was adapted into the folk version by Woody Guthrie and used by many other folk artists, including:

"Talking Dust Bowl Blues" by Woody Guthrie.
"Talking Centralia" by Woody Guthrie.
"Talking Union," by Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, and Millard Lampell
"Atomic Talking Blues" by Vern Partlow
"Talking Inflation Blues" by Tom Glazer
"Talking World War III Blues" by Bob Dylan
"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues" by Bob Dylan
"Talking Birmingham Jam" by Phil Ochs.
"Talking Cuban Crisis" by Phil Ochs.

Show Less
Critical Analysis
Joy as Resistance
The "talking blues" style is fundamentally fune. By using comedy and a half-spoken, rhythmic delivery, artists transform serious topics into engaging performance. This joy is not an escape but a strategic act of resistance, asserting that critique can be delivered with a wry smile.

Resistance
Resistance is at the core of the talking blues, in its folk form. Many of these songs challenge the dominant political, economic, and social narratives.

Power
The talking blues explicitly critiques concentrated power in corporations, media, and government; and gives a voice to marginalized perspectives>.

Humanity
Humor is a deeply human thing. By connecting it to political critique, it reaches people to the soul.

Idealization
The talking blues is a direct challenge to an idealized version of America.

Solidarity
By articulating common struggles in a shared, accessible vernacular, the talking blues is a potent force for building solidarity. An great example is "Talking Union," a union song fostering solidarity as a social and political force.

Assimilation
The accessible micro-genre has been used by many artists beyond folk. A notable example is "Singing in Viet Nam Talking Blues" by Johnny Cash.


Show Less
Lyric Analysis
Class activity

Summary
A variation on the "Save the Last Word" activity, this allows students to analyze lyrics to not only understand what the songs are about but also how they're valuable to political movements.

Talking Blues is a great paired resource, because many of these songs are overtly political.

If the technology is available, the students can also listen to a given song while reading the lyrics to fully appreciate the piece of work.

Students at a table select lyrics that interest them, perhaps for their commentary, prehaps for other reasons. They discuss with their group, then the groups share with the class.

Example:



Talkin Dust Bowl Blues by Woody Guthrie (1940/1964):

Back in Nineteen Twenty-Seven,
I had a little farm and I called that heaven.
Well, the prices up and the rain come down,
And I hauled my crops all into town --
I got the money, bought clothes and groceries,
Fed the kids, and raised a family.

Rain quit and the wind got high,
And the black ol' dust storm filled the sky.
And I swapped my farm for a Ford machine,
And I poured it full of this gas-i-line --
And I started, rockin' an' a-rollin',
Over the mountains, out towards the old Peach Bowl.

Way up yonder on a mountain road,
I had a hot motor and a heavy load,
I's a-goin' pretty fast, there wasn't even stoppin',
A-bouncin' up and down, like popcorn poppin' --
Had a breakdown, sort of a nervous bustdown of some kind,
There was a feller there, a mechanic feller,
Said it was en-gine trouble.
Way up yonder on a mountain curve,
It's way up yonder in the piney wood,
An' I give that rollin' Ford a shove,
An' I's a-gonna coast as far as I could --
Commence coastin', pickin' up speed,
Was a hairpin turn, I didn't make it.

Man alive, I'm a-tellin' you,
The fiddles and the guitars really flew.
That Ford took off like a flying squirrel
An' it flew halfway around the world --
Scattered wives and childrens
All over the side of that mountain.

We got out to the West Coast broke,
So dad-gum hungry I thought I'd croak,
An' I bummed up a spud or two,
An' my wife fixed up a tater stew --
We poured the kids full of it,
Mighty thin stew, though,
You could read a magazine right through it.
Always have figured
That if it'd been just a little bit thinner,
Some of these here politicians
Coulda seen through it.

(Aumuller, 1943)

Why This Source
The widely recognized song has a rich, interesting history.

This allows students to reconsider two songs they may have taken for granted: "This Land Is Your Land" by Woody Guthrie and "God Bless America" by Irvine Berlin.

Summary
Written in 1940 as a response to "God Bless America," which Guthrie couldn't get away from due to constant radio play.

Guthrie felt the lyics to "God Bless America" were too patriotic and sappy, divorced from the tough reality many Americans experienced during the Great Depression.

Originally written with an anti-capitalist bend with the lyrics:
As I went walking I saw a sign there
And on the sign it said “No Trespassing.”
But on the other side it didn't say nothing,
That side was made for you and me.

In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,
By the relief office I seen my people;
As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking
Is this land made for you and me?
(Kennedy Center, n.d.)

He dropeed those lyrics at some point, but the final version still resonates with the listener.

Official lyrics posted in the article:
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York island; From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me.

As I was walking that ribbon of highway,
I saw above me that endless skyway:
I saw below me that golden valley:
This land was made for you and me.

I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts;
And all around me a voice was sounding:
This land was made for you and me.

When the sun came shining, and I was strolling,
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,
As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting:
This land was made for you and me.

As I went walking I saw a sign there
And on the sign it said "No Trespassing."
But on the other side it didn't say nothing,
That side was made for you and me.

In the squares of the city, in the shadow of the steeple,
By the relief office I seen my people;
As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking
Is this land made for you and me?

Nobody living can ever stop me,
As I go walking that freedom highway;
Nobody living can ever make me turn back
This land was made for you and me.
(Kennedy Center, n.d.)


Show Less
Critical Analysis
Idealization
The song directly responds to and challenges the sentimental, shallow patriotism of "God Bless America," which ignored the harsh realities many Americans experienced during the Great Depression.

Resistance
The omitted verses explicitly critique capitalism and private property. Even without them, the song's framing of land as a collective right questions exclusive ownership and inequality.

What does it mean to be American?
The song poses a fundamental question: What does it mean to belong here? Guthrie shifts the focus from a nation "blessed by God" (passive, top-down) to a land "made for you and me" (inclusive, bottom up).

Reclaiming/Reframing
Guthrie's work is a deliberate effort to reclaim the concept of America from a commercial, patriotic mainstream.

Art Time!
Class activity

Summary
There is a strong visual element to "This Land Is Your Land" (Guthrie, 1951).

Students listen to the song and read the lyrics. They then do art, probably drawing or painting, of the visuals the song inspires in them.

Why This Source
One of the most recognized songs during the Civil Rights movement, "We Shall Overcome" has a rich history with an interesting twist.

The song fits into quite a few themes from class.

The first source, from the Library of Congress, provides a wonderful hisotical overview, with the source from the Atlantic adding a coda that is relevant to class.

Summary
"We Shall Overcome" is rooted in I'll Overcome Some Day and I'll be All Right, both rooted in African American culture.

Copyright was made by Pete Seeger, Guy Carawan and Frank Hamilton. Both Pete Seeger and Jamila Jones, who at 12-years-old, in 1956, added a new verse to "We Shall Overcome." Both Seeger and Jones were interviewed as part of this resource.

After Kate Stewart published her article in 2014, it was discovered that a woman by the name of Louise Shropshire wrote a hymn called "If My Jesus Wills" which was claimed to be direct inspiration for "We Shall Overcome".

The copyright to "We Shall Overcome" was challenged in court and voluntarily relinquished by its publishers in 2018 after historical evidence, including Shropshire's hymn, demonstrated the song's status as a traditional folk work in the public domain.

Pete Seeger is rightly upheld as a pillar of integrity and solidarity. Yet even our heroes of any movement are not perfect, complicated by flaws and controversies, such as the disputes surrounding the copyright and attribution for "We Shall Overcome."

Power
The transformative power of song is central, as "We Shall Overcome" was powerfully embraced by the Civil Rights Movement, demonstrating how music can fuel and sustain social change.

Resistance
The song was inherently created and adopted as an anthem of protest, a direct musical tool for challenging injustice and asserting collective strength.

Solidarity
Music like "We Shall Overcome" plays a crucial role in building solidarity, helping to unify diverse individuals within a movement around a shared identity and common purpose.

Humanity
The emphatic "We" in "We Shall Overcome" underscores a fundamental theme: that humanity is not a solitary experience but an interconnected community facing struggles together.

What Does It Mean to Be American?
The song raises core American questions: Who is the "we" that shall overcome? What systemic obstacles must they overcome? And what does their struggle reveal about the nation's ideals and realities?

Erasure
While often unintentional, a notable erasure occurred in the historical narrative of "We Shall Overcome," where a key contributor, Louise Shropshire, was overlooked for decades.

Reframing/Reclaiming
Recent historical revelations about the song's origins have allowed for a reframing of its story, reclaiming the credit and recognition.

Omitted Voices/Stories/Perspectives
The erasure of certain creators points to the broader omission of vital voices and perspectives in popular history, a gap that reclaiming efforts seek to address.

Summary
Since the "We Shall Overcome" resource has many videos within the various references, as well as plenty of shorter readings on the various aspects and history of the song, students have the ability to intellectually roam around.

Creating pods, students go from one pod to another, which has a resouce--either a video playing on a laptop, a short reading or photos--as well as a blank piece of paper for them to write down their thoughts.

After a given amount of time, the students move on to another pod, absorb the material and write down their thoughts.

Critical Analysis for Class Activity
Omitted voices/stories/perspectives
Part of the inspiration for this is that Louise Shropshire did not receive proper credit for her contribution to the song. Having the students participate via silent conversation will hopefull connect some dots.

Dramatization
We should consider if this is dramatization. I would say no, as this connection will not be explicitly made. Perhaps students will notice during a debrief. However, since silent conversation is an establsiehd classroom activity, I would not consider it a gimmick here.

Playlist

Schimmer, J. (n.d.). Folk Music Revival [Spotify playlist]. Spotify. Retrieved from https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ofsb1cZp22w31JUzUeqav


Why This Source
If we're going to talk about music, let's have a playlist!

Summary
A playlist of (mostly) folk music that is (mostly) politically inclined and (mostly) from the 1940s through the 1960s. Mostly.

All kidding aside, this playlist is intended to be accommodating and evolving. I will cite specific songs used in other resources, but given the breadth of possible songs, I have chosen to cite the entire Spotify playlist here.

Songs can be added as appropriate for a given class, especially for windows and mirrors.

Critical Analysis
The beauty of the playlist is that you can find a song for any theme we've discussed in class. That being said, here are a few 'meta' considerations.

Omitted voices/stories/perspectives
This playlist currently centers American artists and songs. If students come from cultures with different folk song lineage, they should be added.

Windows and Mirrors
This provides an opportunity to allow students to find folk from their families' cultures as well as see the American folk tradition.

Link from past to present
Adding contemporary songs should always be welcome.

Solidarity
Folk music built collective identity around shared struggles. Singing together at rallies or picket lines was an act of unity.

Power
The playlist showcases music as a tool of cultural power. It gave a voice to the marginalized, challenged dominant narratives, and mobilized public opinion around social and political issues.

Summary
A hootenanny is a fun, fairly informal musical event connected to folk music.

This can be treated as part talent show, part dance, part sing-along. To prepare, the class selects a shortlist of folk songs. A "request board" can gather song ideas. A collection of instruments, if available, should be included (tambourines, shakers, etc). An optional, low-pressure sign-up sheet allows students to volunteer for special roles, like performing a short verse, leading a dance, or performing a talent.

The hootenanny itself flows through communal activities, which could include: sing-alongs, a supportive "talent sprouts" segment for brief student performances, and an active folk dance or parade. The goal is to create a living memory of music made by and for the community, perfectly embodying the spirit of folk music.

Critical Analysis for Class Activity
Joy as Resistance
Much like traditional hootenannies, this is a joyous event. However, making sure to include the ethos of folk--helping one another, acknowledging the troubles in the world--should be incorporated.

Dramatization
Class parties are fairly common, so incorporating elements from a folk music unit is acceptable. Mind should be taken into what songs, activities and talents are ultimately chosen.
