                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Many people associate rock & roll with counter-culture, but folk music actually played a more significant and earlier role. With roots in an anti-racist, anti-corporate, and often anti-capitalist ethos, folk music provided the soundtrack for a counter-narrative. In the 1940s, musicians like Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger wrote pro-union anthems, while artists like Lead Belly performed songs rooted in the Black experience that highlighted American racism.</p>
                    <p>This tradition continued throughout the 1950s and peaked in the 1960s, which produced the best-known names in folk: Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Peter, Paul & Mary. Paradoxically, folk's mainstream success may have contributed to its decline, as commercial incentives diluted its anti-establishment roots.</p>
                    <p>Folk music offers a powerful case study in the symbiotic relationship between protest and art. Teaching it, however, must include the flaws of its icons such as Guthrie and Seeger. We can only fully honor these artists by humanizing them. Another pitfall is losing the forest for the trees; it is not enough to simply play folk songs. Songs must be carefully contextualized and curated for their political relationships so students can understand the connection between art and social movements.</p>
                    <p>This annotated bibliography supports educators in teaching the Folk Music Revival through primary sources, critical themes, and classroom activities.</p>
